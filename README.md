Arrays: write a program that asks the user for a number, creates an array of that many numbers where each item is as follows:
array => [1, 2, . . . , num]
Then, the program is to iterate through the array and sum up all the numbers.

program 5

Methods: take program number 4 above and modify it so that the sum calculation takes place in a method that takes the array as its parameter and returns the sum of the items.
